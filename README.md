# My Very First Website

Welcome!

This is not only my very first website, but also my very first fully-fleshed coding project!

With this project, I hope to better familiarize myself with both the HTML and CSS languages.

I also hope to deepen my understanding of a well-used CLI, and storing/hosting my code on an external server, such as GitHub.

There's a lot of moving components here for an amateur developer so expect many broken links and other newbie-typical faux-pas (faux-pases?)

With any luck the final project will look semi-professional, and will help set me up for the other milestone projects later in my course.
